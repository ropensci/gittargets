## Prework

* [ ] Read and agree to the [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/) and [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/gittargets/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* [ ] If there is [already a relevant issue](https://github.com/ropensci/gittargets/issues), whether open or closed, comment on the existing thread instead of posting a new issue.
* [ ] Post a [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) like [this one](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/256#issuecomment-754229683) so the maintainer can troubleshoot the problems you identify. A reproducible example is:
    * [ ] **Runnable**: post enough R code and data so any onlooker can create the error on their own computer.
    * [ ] **Minimal**: reduce runtime wherever possible and remove complicated details that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.
    * [ ] **Readable**: format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

## Benchmarks

How poorly does `gittargets` perform? To find out, we recommend you use the [`proffer`](https://github.com/r-prof/proffer) package and take screenshots of the results displayed in your browser.

```r
library(gittargets)
library(proffer)
px <- pprof({
  # All your gittargets code goes here.
})
```
