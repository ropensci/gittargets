Title: Data Version Control for the Targets Package
Description: Pipelines with the 'targets' R package
  (2021, <doi:10.21105/joss.02959>) skip steps that
  are up to already date. Although this behavior reduces the runtime
  of subsequent runs, it comes at the cost of overwriting previous
  results. So if the pipeline source code is under version control,
  and if you revert to a previous commit or branch,
  the data will no longer be up to date with the code you
  just checked out. Ordinarily, you would need to rerun the
  pipeline in order to recover the targets you had before.
  However, 'gittargets' preserves historical output,
  creating version control snapshots of data store.
  Each data snapshot remembers the contemporaneous Git commit
  of the pipeline source code, so you can recover the right
  data when you navigate the Git history. In other words,
  'gittargets' makes it possible to switch commits or branches
  without invalidating the pipeline. You can simply check out
  the up-to-date targets from the past instead of taking the
  time to recompute them from scratch.
